Second round  Interview for CCSE 

# Task 1:
The approach involves using the Fetch API to request data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Upon receiving the JSON data, the script dynamically creates individual blog cards for each post using DOM manipulation. These cards are then appended to the HTML container, with styling applied for a visually appealing presentation, including a Times New Roman font, capitalized text, and a subtle box shadow.

Files:
index.html: The HTML file includes a container where the dynamically generated blog cards will be appended.
script.js: The JavaScript file contains an event listener for the DOMContentLoaded event. It makes an API request to retrieve data from "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts". The data is then used to create blog cards using the "createBlogCard" function and appended to the HTML container.

# Task 2: Integer Sum Calculator
In Task 2, the program takes input from the user: the total number of elements and a list of integers (including negative and positive integers). The input is passed to the "sum_check" function, which checks if each element is an integer. If it is, the program calculates the sum of positive integers using the built-in "sum" function in Python.

Files:
integer_sum_calculator.py: This Python script takes user input, checks for integers, and calculates the sum of positive integers using the "sum" function.

# How to Run 
Task 1:
Open index.html in a web browser.
The blog cards will be dynamically generated and displayed in the container.

Task 2:
Run integer_sum_calculator.py in a Python environment.
Enter the total number of elements and the list of integers as prompted.
The program will calculate and display the sum of positive integers.
